# Non-Per-Clock: A proposal for a personal non-linear clock system

## Features

* non-linear, meaning the clock changes faster of slower during the day
* duodecimal system, meaning we adopt the natural base-12 way of thinking
* cyclic, time is cyclic in nature due to how life is supported in our planetary system, we can make this even clearer by making the start and the end of the clock the same
* non-monotonic, the clock goes forward and backwards and oscillates around 0
* personal, in the manner that it relates to your location and amount of daylight
